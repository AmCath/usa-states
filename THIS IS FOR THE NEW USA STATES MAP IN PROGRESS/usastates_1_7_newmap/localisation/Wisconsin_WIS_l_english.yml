Wisconsin_weaponizenucleartechnology:0 "Weaponize Nuclear Technology"
Wisconsin_weaponizenucleartechnology_desc:0 "Our advances in nuclear technology have far surpassed our expectations. We've learned many things, such as that nuclear reactions can be used as a sustainable fuel source. They can also be quite deadly. Perhaps the deadly factor can be exploited to our benefit."

Wisconsin_thewisconsinitekaiser:0 "The Wisconsinite Kaiser"
Wisconsin_thewisconsinitekaiser_desc:0 "Our nation is undoubtedly German. From Milwaukee to Superior, we are a nation built upon German values, culture, and spirit. Who better to rule as a king than a Kaiser? In the first Great War, we were quite hesitant to join against our German brothers, and with the appalling Treaty of Versailles, the German Empire was dead. We must right the wrongs of the past, and create a new future in which the Kaiser is the one and only ruler of Wisconsin."
Wisconsin_neveranotherversailles:0 "Never Another Versailles"
Wisconsin_neveranotherversailles_desc:0 "With our newly created Kaiserdom, we cannot afford such a horrid fate as the German Empire of Europe. Our military is in dire need of growth and development, and though we only have access to the Great Lakes, we can do with a much better navy. We will be so powerful that no one can put us down."

Wisconsin_denouncethegenevaconventions_desc:0 "We are held back by the Geneva Conventions. There is no law in war; why should we abide by some document created in Switzerland of all places.

Wisconsin_bismarkianprinciples_desc:0 "Otto von Bismark, perhaps one of the greatest Germans to have ever lived, was a great strategist, and knew how to run his country better than most of even our era. His shoes are ours to fill now, and if it is possible for us to become as great as even his nation was, we will accomplish it."
Wisconsin_theantifascistbund:0 "The Anti-Fascist Bund"
Wisconsin_theantifascistbund_desc:0 "We hate to admit it, but the Bund is an incredible way to unify the people of German descent in America. We can possibly help the people of the Bund learn a better way, one that doesn't involve... fascism... but instead the following of the great Kaiser. The German fascists of our nation are simply misguided, and when they begin to follow our leadership, our nation will only become greater with their help."
Wisconsin_doawaywiththebund:0 "Do Away With the Bund"
Wisconsin_doawaywiththebund_desc:0 "The Bund is completely unnecessary. Our people do not need to "come together" right now. It'd be in our best interest to just have our own Wisconsinite nation-state that works towards the betterment of itself and not Germans as a whole."

Wisconsin_voterregistrationact:0 "Voter Registration Act"
Wisconsin_voterregistrationact_desc:0 "Elections are the most important part of a nation's leadership.

Wisconsin_civilianfactoriesiii:0 "Civilian Factories III"

Wisconsin_theforwardproject:0 "The Forward Project"
Wisconsin_theforwardproject_desc:0 "Our surplus of resources, weapons, and civilian goods is more than enough to supply our nation's scientists with what they need to conduct their work.
