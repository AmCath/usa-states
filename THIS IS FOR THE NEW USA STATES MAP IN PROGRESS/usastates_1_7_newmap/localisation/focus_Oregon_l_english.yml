ORE_thestateoforegon:0 "The State of Oregon"
ORE_thestateoforegon_desc:0 "Ever since the fall of the Union, the State of Oregon has been in a state of utter chaos. The government of Oregon, formed after the National Guard seized Salem in the chaos of the Collapse, has little to no actual control of the state outside of Salem itself.

To the north and west lies the Oregonian Commune, formed from the Communist Party of Oregon and the Industrial Workers of The World, the two merged to form the Oregon Revolutionary Collective, under the iron chairmanship of John Reed, seen as the only 'moderate' figure in ORC. They wish to see Oregon become a cradle for socialism on the West Coast, but for both factions 'socialism' means something completely different.

To the south and east lies the 'Republic' of Oregon, led by the ruthless George Baker. Make no mistake, Baker's republic is little more than a mask to hide the fascist beast underneath. Baker is by far the most powerful enemy of the government in Salem. Baker's main goal in all things is to build 'Greater Oregon' by reclaiming the entirety of the Oregon Country of old.

The only true democratic faction left in Oregon is based in Salem, along with the National Guard government. The conservatives are led by Harry Boivin, while the progressives are led by William U'Ren. Both men hope to bring the torch of Liberty back to Oregon, but that seems a far off dream by nearly all parties in Oregon.

So what is the state of the State of Oregon? Chaotic."
