 battle_royale.2.t:0 "Welcome to Battle Royale!"
 battle_royale.2.d:0 "Once the battle royale starts, all existing non-civil wars will immediately end with white peace, all puppets will be freed, all factions will be dismantled, and every country will declare war on their militarily weakest neighbor, if any, or will navally invade a weak nearby country. Countries will now exclusively annex in peace conferences and will immediately gain cores on all owned states, while annexed country cores will be removed. AI countries will neither propose nor accept any diplomatic actions. Human players will be able to form factions among themselves, but they will be dismantled once nothing else remains. The last country standing wins."
